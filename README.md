## Overview

This project is built using dbt (data build tool), which enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. dbt allows you to write modular SQL queries, manage dependencies, and create a robust data pipeline.

## Features

- **Modular SQL**: Break down complex queries into smaller, reusable components.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your data models using Git.
- **Documentation**: Automatically generate documentation for your data models.
- **Testing**: Implement tests to ensure data quality and integrity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- dbt installed on your machine. You can install it using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install dbt
  ```

- Access to a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my_dbt_project.git
   cd my_dbt_project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   dbt deps
   ```

### Usage

To run your dbt models, use the following command:

```bash

```

To test your models, use:

```bash
